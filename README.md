CogNetX is an advanced, multimodal neural network architecture inspired by human cognition. It integrates speech, vision, and video processing into one unified framework. Built with PyTorch, CogNetX leverages cutting-edge neural networks such as Transformers, Conformers, and CNNs to handle complex multimodal tasks. The architecture is designed to process inputs like speech, images, and video, and output coherent, human-like text.

## Key Features
- **Speech Processing**: Uses a Conformer network to handle speech inputs with extreme efficiency and accuracy.
- **Vision Processing**: Employs a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for robust image understanding.
- **Video Processing**: Utilizes a 3D CNN architecture for real-time video analysis and feature extraction.
- **Text Generation**: Integrates a Transformer model to process and generate human-readable text, combining the features from speech, vision, and video.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines multiple input streams into a unified architecture, mimicking how humans process various types of sensory information.

## Architecture Overview

CogNetX brings together several cutting-edge neural networks:
- **Conformer** for high-quality speech recognition.
- **Transformer** for text generation and processing.
- **ResNet** for vision and image recognition tasks.
- **3D CNN** for video stream processing.

The architecture is designed to be highly modular, allowing easy extension and integration of additional modalities.

## Installation


```bash

$ pip3 install -U cognetx

```

### Model Architecture

```python
import torch
from cognetx.model import CogNetX

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example configuration and usage
    config = {
        "speech_input_dim": 80,  # For example, 80 Mel-filterbank features
        "speech_num_layers": 4,
        "speech_num_heads": 8,
        "encoder_dim": 256,
        "decoder_dim": 512,
        "vocab_size": 10000,
        "embedding_dim": 512,
        "decoder_num_layers": 6,
        "decoder_num_heads": 8,
        "dropout": 0.1,
        "depthwise_conv_kernel_size": 31,
    }

    model = CogNetX(config)

    # Dummy inputs
    batch_size = 2
    speech_input = torch.randn(
        batch_size, 500, config["speech_input_dim"]
    )  # (batch_size, time_steps, feature_dim)
    vision_input = torch.randn(
        batch_size, 3, 224, 224
    )  # (batch_size, 3, H, W)
    video_input = torch.randn(
        batch_size, 3, 16, 112, 112
    )  # (batch_size, 3, time_steps, H, W)
    tgt_input = torch.randint(
        0, config["vocab_size"], (20, batch_size)
    )  # (tgt_seq_len, batch_size)

    # Forward pass
    output = model(speech_input, vision_input, video_input, tgt_input)
    print(
        output.shape
    )  # Expected: (tgt_seq_len, batch_size, vocab_size)

```

### Example Pipeline

1. **Speech Input**: Provide raw speech data or features extracted via an MFCC filter.
2. **Vision Input**: Use images or frame snapshots from video.
3. **Video Input**: Feed the network with video sequences.
4. **Text Output**: The model will generate a text output based on the combined multimodal input.

### Running the Example

To test CogNetX with some example data, run:

```bash
python example.py
```
