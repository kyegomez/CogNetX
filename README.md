CogNetX is an advanced, multimodal neural network architecture inspired by human cognition. It integrates speech, vision, and video processing into one unified framework. Built with PyTorch, CogNetX leverages cutting-edge neural networks such as Transformers, Conformers, and CNNs to handle complex multimodal tasks. The architecture is designed to process inputs like speech, images, and video, and output coherent, human-like text.

## Key Features
- **Speech Processing**: Uses a Conformer network to handle speech inputs with extreme efficiency and accuracy.
- **Vision Processing**: Employs a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for robust image understanding.
- **Video Processing**: Utilizes a 3D CNN architecture for real-time video analysis and feature extraction.
- **Text Generation**: Integrates a Transformer model to process and generate human-readable text, combining the features from speech, vision, and video.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines multiple input streams into a unified architecture, mimicking how humans process various types of sensory information.

## Architecture Overview

CogNetX brings together several cutting-edge neural networks:
- **Conformer** for high-quality speech recognition.
- **Transformer** for text generation and processing.
- **ResNet** for vision and image recognition tasks.
- **3D CNN** for video stream processing.

The architecture is designed to be highly modular, allowing easy extension and integration of additional modalities.

### Neural Networks Used
- **Speech**: [Conformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100)
- **Vision**: [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
- **Video**: [3D CNN (R3D-18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11248)
- **Text**: [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

## Installation

To set up and use CogNetX, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CogNetX.git
cd CogNetX
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Torchvision
- Torchaudio

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

## Usage

### Model Architecture

```python
import torch
from cognetx import CogninexusNet

model = CogninexusNet()
speech_data = torch.rand(1, 80, 100)  # Example speech input
vision_data = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Example vision input
video_data = torch.rand(1, 3, 16, 112, 112)  # Example video input
text_data = torch.rand(10, 32, 512)  # Example text input

output = model(speech_data, vision_data, video_data, text_data)
print(output)
```

### Example Pipeline

1. **Speech Input**: Provide raw speech data or features extracted via an MFCC filter.
2. **Vision Input**: Use images or frame snapshots from video.
3. **Video Input**: Feed the network with video sequences.
4. **Text Output**: The model will generate a text output based on the combined multimodal input.

### Running the Example

To test CogNetX with some example data, run:

```bash
python example.py
```
